# Api client TypeScript

The backend application can automatically create a TypeScript client to be used in frontend
applications. It is used in the People front application itself.

This client is made with [openapi-typescript-codegen](https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen)
and People's backend OpenAPI schema (available [here](http://localhost:8071/v1.0/swagger/) if you have the backend running).

## Requirements

We'll need the online OpenAPI schema generated by swagger. Therefore you will first need to
install the backend application.

## Install openApiClientJs

```sh
$ cd src/tsclient
$ yarn install
```

## Generate the client

```sh
yarn generate:api:client:local <output_path_for_generated_client>
```
