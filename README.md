# People

People is an application to handle users and teams.

People is built on top of [Django Rest
Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

## Getting started

### Prerequisite

Make sure you have a recent version of Docker and [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed on your laptop:

```bash
$ docker -v
  Docker version 20.10.2, build 2291f61

$ docker compose -v
  docker compose version 1.27.4, build 40524192
```

> ⚠️ You may need to run the following commands with `sudo` but this can be
> avoided by assigning your user to the `docker` group.

### Project bootstrap

The easiest way to start working on the project is to use GNU Make:

```bash
$ make bootstrap
```

This command builds the `app` container, installs dependencies, performs
database migrations and compile translations. It's a good idea to use this
command each time you are pulling code from the project repository to avoid
dependency-releated or migration-releated issues.

Your Docker services should now be up and running 🎉

Note that if you need to run them afterwards, you can use the eponym Make rule:

```bash
$ make run
```

### Adding content

You can create a basic demo site by running:

    $ make demo

Finally, you can check all available Make rules using:

```bash
$ make help
```

### Django admin

You can access the Django admin site at
[http://localhost:8071/admin](http://localhost:8071/admin).

You first need to create a superuser account:

```bash
$ make superuser
```
